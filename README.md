#STREAM (Smart Translation Enabling and Aiding Multi-cultral populations)

Description:

In cases where non-English speakers, typically refugees or 'newcomers' to the region, seek medical care, health care staff members must quickly identify the patient's language so that the appropriate interpreter can be called.
The goal of this project is to streamline or shorten the time for the intake processes for non-English speaking patients(specially Nepali and non-Nepali) and their families by developing a digital language identification tool for health care providers and first responders.

Dataset (complete):

*Nepali Data: 

**	115 audio files (10 â€“ 40 mins) , 2.42 GB(Zip)
**	Splitted to 11,424 files (10 Sec), 19.4 GB

*Other Language Data: 

**	From Topcoder:78,496 files, 5.5 GB(Zip)
**	Non Nepali Data of 10 sec each
**176 Languages
**	Each language has 446 sample files


Dataset (sample):

Training dataset: 2069 audio files 
Test Dataset: 398 files 

Feature Extraction: used MFCC
